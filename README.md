# YAMA.py

## Description

This is a web application for downloading YouTube videos in the best available format and also the best available audio format if the user wishes to download it in audio form. This application uses the **YouTube DL** library available in Python, and so we preferred using the **Django framework** for both the front end and backend as it is a Python-based framework.
